**Introduction**

The Math Practice application is designed to help users of all ages improve their arithmetic skills through engaging practice sessions. You can solve problems across four operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, with customizable modes and timed challenges.
Getting Started
    1. Launch the Application:
        ◦ Run the Python script in your preferred environment.
        ◦ A window will appear with math problems and interactive controls.
    2. Understand the Layout:
        ◦ Problem Area: The top section displays the current math problem.
        ◦ Answer Input: Below the problem, you can type your answer in the input box and press Enter (or the keypad Enter key) to submit.
        ◦ Feedback Section: Displays messages about your answers (e.g., correct, incorrect, or timeout).
        ◦ Score Display: Tracks your accuracy as a percentage.
        ◦ Control Panel:
            ▪ Buttons for selecting modes (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, and Mixed Mode).
            ▪ A slider to adjust the time limit for timed mode.
            ▪ A checkbox to toggle timed mode.
            ▪ A "Quit" button to exit the program.

**Step-by-Step Instructions**

1. Solving Problems
    • Read the Problem: Look at the problem in the problem area (e.g., 5 x 3).
    • Enter Your Answer: Type your answer in the text box and press Enter (or the keypad Enter key).
    • Receive Feedback:
        ◦ Correct Answer: A message like "Correct! Great job!" appears in green.
        ◦ Incorrect Answer: A message like "Incorrect! The answer was 15" appears in red.
        ◦ Timeout (if in timed mode): A message like "You failed to answer on a timely manner! - The Result is 15" appears in red if time runs out.
2. Switching Modes
    • Click one of the mode buttons:
        ◦ Addition Only: Focuses only on addition problems.
        ◦ Subtraction Only: Focuses only on subtraction problems.
        ◦ Multiplication Only: Focuses only on multiplication problems.
        ◦ Division Only: Focuses only on division problems.
        ◦ Mixed Mode: Generates problems from all four operations randomly.
    • A message will confirm the selected mode (e.g., "Mode set to Addition!").
3. Enabling Timed Mode
    • Check the "Timed Mode" box to enable the timer.
    • Use the slider to adjust the time limit (from 5 to 30 seconds).
    • Solve each problem before the timer expires to avoid a timeout message.
4. Checking Your Score
    • The score display updates automatically after each problem.
    • Example: "Score: 75%" means you answered 75% of the problems correctly.
5. Exiting the Program
    • Click the "Quit" button to exit the application safely.
Tips for Use
    • Younger Learners: Start with "Addition Only" or "Subtraction Only" modes and longer time limits (20–30 seconds).
    • Advanced Learners: Use "Mixed Mode" with shorter time limits (5–10 seconds) for a challenge.
    • Practice Regularly: Consistent use will improve speed and accuracy over time.

**Troubleshooting**
    • Problem with Timer: Ensure the "Timed Mode" box is checked if you want to use the timer.
    • Incorrect Answers: Review feedback and double-check your input for typos or miscalculations.
    • Quit Button Not Working: Ensure the application is in focus when clicking "Quit."
